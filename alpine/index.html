        <h2>Do You Know Me?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> I'm <span style="color: rgb(49, 136, 158);">Yasoob Kamili</span>, a curious developer with a
            screwdriver in one hand and a trekking pole in the other. Whether I’m exploring alpine lakes and hidden
            meadows or diving deep into the internals of code and hardware, I live for the thrill of discovery. Peaks
            excite me—both in the mountains and in technology. I like to open almost everything, from devices to ideas,
            just to see how they work and how I can make them better.
            Sometimes, though, things don’t work after I open them—but that’s part of the fun.
            This blog is where I share my <span style="color: rgb(12, 96,117);">climbs</span>, my <span
                style="color: rgb(12, 96,117);">code</span>, and everything
            in between.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Can I Walk on Mountains?</h2>
    <div style="width: 100%;">
        <p>I’ve always been drawn to mountains, even as a child. There’s something about their towering presence that
            captured my imagination. As I grew, that fascination turned into a passion for trekking.
            <span style="color: rgb(12, 96, 117);">So, can I walk on mountains?</span>
            Yes—and I do, every chance I get. For me, mountains aren’t just landscapes; they’re challenges, teachers,
            and quiet companions. I’ve wandered through alpine lakes, traced meadows kissed by clouds, and stood beneath
            peaks that made me feel small in the best way. Trekking is where I find clarity—it’s where my questions echo
            back with unexpected answers. Every trail I take is a step closer to understanding not just the terrain, but
            myself.

                <i>Dumail</i></span>, The First Trail </h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                <span class="date">11 July 2021</span><br>
                The trek begins from Naranag village, situated at around 2277 meters above sea level. A few hundred
                meters into the trail, trekkers pass by ancient Hindu temples, offering a quick historical stop.

                After approximately 4 km and 2 hours of trekking, Dumail is reached at ~2400 m ASL. The trail up to
                Dumail features minimal elevation gain and is rated as easy. The name “Dumail” is derived from “Du”
                (two) and “Mail” (join), marking the confluence of two rivers—Marchoi Nala and another stream
                originating from Gangbal Lake. These form the Wangath River. A distinctive wooden bridge at Dumail marks
                the crossing point to the next section of the trail.

                From Dumail, the trail transitions into a moderate gradient ascent through alpine meadows for the next 5
                km. This section involves a steady climb with scenic views of the surrounding forested ridgelines and
                open pastures.

                After approximately 4 additional hours of trekking, the Harmukh peaks come into view, signaling
                proximity to Marchoi Valley, which sits at an altitude of about 2850 m ASL.

                The trek begins from Hirpora village in Shopian at ~2385 meters above sea level. Trekking in this area
                usually requires prior permission due to its proximity to sensitive zones and the Hirpora Wildlife
                Sanctuary.

                At around 600 meters into the trail, trekkers reach Zrado, followed by a gradual ascent to Baliwal. The
                trail transitions from forested sections of Shahkoot to more open terrain, and at approximately 6.5 km
                from the
                trailhead, the Tsurgul Pass is reached. This pass offers the view to Badgam's Shein Meuin
                Peak and first major alpine vista,
                opening up into expansive meadows and panoramic views of the Pir Panjal range, including prominent peaks
                like Brahmasakli(of Kulgam), Dhakyar(of Shopian), Sunder Top (of Banihal) and more.

                After crossing the pass, a further 3.5 km leads to the final destination—Rainuer Meadows—at ~3185 m ASL.
                The meadows are vast, lush, and relatively less explored, believed to be the second-largest alpine
                meadow in Kashmir. The terrain is grassy, interspersed with boulders and occasional seasonal streams.

                Although the standard route is a circuit trek (Hirpora → Rainuer → Dubjan
                Bridge), the group had to return via the same route due to an injury to one member.

                During the descent, the group was warmly hosted by local nomads at a hut near the trail. Around 15
                members of the team were served noon chai, roti, and fresh homemade butter. Despite offering to pay, the
                nomads politely refused any compensation, showcasing typical high-altitude hospitality.

        <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;">Mahadev Peak Basecamp:<span style="font-family:system-ui">
                <i>Lidwas</i></span> </h3>
        <div class="bg">
            <p>

                <span class="date">25 June 2023</span><br>
            <h3>Route Overview</h3>
            <p>Originally intended as a one-day summit attempt to Mahadev Peak (3966 m ASL), the plan had to be modified
                due to road closures in Srinagar caused by a cycle race, resulting in a two-hour delay. The team
                initiated the trek from Scholar’s School, Dhara (2030 m ASL) without any breaks.

                After the initial stretch, the trail passed Padshah Pal, followed by an approach toward Bobjan, a
                section known for high bear activity and considered one of the more dangerous segments of the route.
                Several members reported past bear encounters here.

                Following multiple stream crossings, the trail entered Wovur Gul, a steep and energy-intensive climb.
                After gaining elevation in Wovur Gul, Lidwas became visible at a distance. It took about an hour from
                this point to reach Lidwas.</p>
            <h3>Lidwas & Above</h3>
            <p>Lidwas serves as a seasonal settlement for nomadic communities during the six months of summer. The team
                reached Lidwas around 1:30 PM. Out of 20 members, 5 decided to push further above Lidwas for better
                vantage points of Mahadev Peak.The group ascended an additional hour, reaching an altitude of
                approximately 3520 m ASL, which provided
                unobstructed views of Mahadev Peak and surrounding ridgelines. On the descent back to Lidwas, a wildlife
                sighting occurred—an animal with a furry tail was initially suspected to be a fox, but was later
                confirmed via binoculars to be a Himalayan Marmot, a first-time sighting for the group.</p>
            <h3>Return Journey</h3>
            <p>While descending, the team retraced the same route. At Bobjan, a group member narrowly avoided stepping
                on a green snake, marking another notable wildlife encounter. After exiting Bobjan, the trail gradually
                eased, allowing the group to recover from the more challenging sections.</p>

                The Shilsar Lakes trek began from Margan Top (~3700 m ASL), a high-altitude pass connecting Islamabad
                with Kishtwar, after a 120 km drive from Srinagar. The trail starts to the right of the pass
                with an initial steep ridge followed by a gradual ascent through alpine terrain. Out of the four Shilsar
                lakes, only two were visited on this route as the remaining are more accessible from a different
                approach. Shilsar 1 (~3900 m ASL) was reached around 12:30 PM with an estimated surface area of 6310 sq.
                meters (season-dependent), followed by Shilsar 2 (~3920 m ASL) after a 20-minute trek where the team had
                lunch during rain and hail. The lakes marked the trekker’s first alpine lake experience, with distant
                views of Nun and Kun peaks visible from Margan Top. The descent concluded at 4:00 PM, with tea at a
                local dhaba owned by Majid, and departure from Margan Top at 5:30 PM.

                The trek to Arshan Lake began after a ~110 km drive from Srinagar to Sinthan Top, a high-altitude pass
                in South Kashmir. From there, the trail led into Arshan Valley, and after a few hours of trekking, the
                group reached Arshan Sar (also known as Drinyan Sar). The route then continued via a steep, rocky ascent
                to Drinyansar Pass (~4170 m ASL), which offers panoramic views of Zednag, Nehnag, and the Famber Valley.
                A sharp descent from the pass led to Zednag followed by Nehnag, a distinctive kidney-shaped alpine lake.
                I further explored the region by ascending to Hoksar 1 before descending back to Zednag. The
                group then retraced the trail back over Drinyansar Pass and reached Sinthan Top by sunset, completing a
                high-altitude circuit through a rugged and scenic section of Sinthan.

                The Choharnag trek began with a 120 km drive from Srinagar to Margan Top, after which the trail started
                towards the left of the pass. A steep ridge was crossed within the first hour, and after approximately 4
                km of trekking, the group reached Choharnag 1, part of a cluster of four alpine lakes collectively named
                Choharnag (meaning "four springs"). Known as one of the easiest alpine lake treks in the region, the
                route continued to Choharnag 2, the largest of the four, followed by Choharnag 3, considered the most
                scenic. The final lake, Choharnag 4, was reached before ascending a steep 200-meter ridge to Khellan Top
                (~4300 m ASL), a vantage point offering expansive views of Khellan Nag Lake, whose deep blue color was
                attributed to mineral content and light angle. From this high point, Shilsar 1 and 2 were also visible
                through binoculars, previously visited on an earlier trek. Lakes Choharnag 1, 2, and 3 were clearly
                visible from the ridge. After lunch at Khellan Top, the group descended back to Margan Top and concluded
                the day with tea at Majid’s dhaba, also visited during the Shilsar trek.

                The Sheeshnag trek began after a 90 km drive from Srinagar to Chandanwari (~2740 m ASL), though the
                journey was delayed due to two flat tyres—resolved with help from a local Tavera driver who provided a
                spare. After tea and pakoras in Pahalgam, the group began the trek from Chandanwari. The trail, fully
                concretized by BRO as part of the Amarnath Yatra route, was easy to follow and allowed for a fast pace.
                Two members of the group quickly ascended to Pissu Top, rejoining another trekking group encountered
                earlier. The trail then passed Zojibal, home to an Army camp and BRO quarters, where mild snowfall
                began. These two trekkers reached Sheeshnag Lake (~3600 m ASL) around 12:30 PM after covering 9 km;
                snowfall intensified, reducing visibility to 100–200 feet. The rest of the group arrived at 1:40 PM.
                After
                lunch, the sky cleared, revealing Sheeshnag Lake surrounded by fresh snow-covered peaks. The group began
                descending at 3 PM and reached Chandanwari before departing back to Srinagar.
